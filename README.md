# SIMPLE WEBSITE MADE FOR UNIVERSITY PROJECTS

A simple and clean website built purely with HTML5 and CSS3. This project was created to [state your purpose, e.g., "showcase my web development projects," "act as a personal landing page," or "practice modern HTML/CSS techniques"].

This is a static website, meaning it uses no backend or database. All content is served directly from the HTML files.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts smoothly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Lightweight and Fast:** Built with clean HTML and optimized CSS for fast loading times.
* **Semantic HTML:** Uses modern HTML5 tags (like `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) for better accessibility and SEO.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness (including Flexbox/Grid).
* *(Optional: **JavaScript (ES6+):** For any dynamic features, like a mobile menu toggle or a modal window.)*

## üèÅ How to Run Locally

No special tools or builds are required! Since this is a static site, you can run it just by opening the main file in your browser.

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [URL_DO_SEU_REPOSITORIO]
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```sh

    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your favorite browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

That's it!
